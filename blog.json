This is the first ever post on our new official blog!\n\nWe have moved from Netlify and Svelte alone to SvelteKit and Cloudflare pages! This is a great day for mankind (not really, but it's a really productive day for me and I'm proud of it).\nThis means there will be:\n- Fast speeds\n- Secure website\n- Nice UI overhaul\n\nNow, time for Discord Updates. Feel free to skip this if you saw my announcement in the Discord today.\nI've added some basic plugins for the server, this means it should be a bit faster and easier for me to moderate.\nAfter countless requests, I've added a #suggestions channel for your great, or possibly bad suggestions.\nI've added channel descriptions on most of the channels, nobody reads them but it should give new people a sense of guidance.\nI've added about 18 more maps today, and we are now on top.gg.\n\nOverall, I really like how productive today was. Don't forget to join our discord, and stay safe!"

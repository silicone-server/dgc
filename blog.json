This is the first ever post on our new official blog!\n\nWe have moved from Netlify and Svelte alone to SvelteKit and Cloudflare pages! This is a great day for mankind (not really, but it's a really productive day for me and I'm proud of it).\nThis means there will be:\n- Fast speeds\n- Secure website\n- Nice UI overhaul\n\nOverall, I really like how productive today was. Don't forget to join our discord, and stay safe!"
